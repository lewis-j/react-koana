export const aboutPageText = `Koana had her soft opening in August 2019. She is a
                        local Hawaiian specialty shop, located in the Mountain
                        View Village, halfway point between Hilo and Hawaiʻi
                        Volcanoes National Park. Koana was thoughtfully designed
                        and put together by my wife and I. Back in 2017, as
                        longtime coffee lovers, we began to seek out and gather
                        a diverse selection of rare and award-winning coffees
                        from local farms and roasters. For two years, we juggled
                        our work schedules and parenthood in order to visit
                        between Hawaii, Tokyo, and Taipei, to further educate
                        ourselves in coffee. We were thrilled to open our
                        understanding for coffee and the cultures it fuels. In
                        our mind, coffee is a comfort food. The first step of
                        recommending good coffee is to understand the people, in
                        order to provide an impactful and personal coffee
                        experience. We focus on talking story, it’s our way to
                        exchange our aloha through our coffee stories. As many
                        may already know, to live on the Big Island, we have to
                        be creative with our resources. So one day, we
                        thought…why not make Koana a sit-specific space, a space
                        that exhibits its history and journey. In order to bring
                        forth the rich history of Mountain View Village and its
                        flavors, we built Koana’s indoor décor and outdoor
                        seating area with mostly recycled materials and
                        reclaimed wood from our neighborhood. We gathered them
                        personally, piece by piece, and you would be surprised
                        how much treasure (sometime junk) you could find around
                        you. We designed the indoor space as our living room to
                        enjoy coffee in a positive vibe, and the outdoor seating
                        area right at the old Mountain View Theater site. You
                        could still see the slop in the seating area! We hope to
                        see you often, talking coffee and exchanging wisdom.
                        After all, if we can survive and thrive under Covid, the
                        least we deserve is a damn good cup of coffee. Simple
                        happiness.`;
